# Readme for new scripts n' stuff

## Build
Basically just runs `cmake ..` with all the args we need.

**How to run:**
```bash
./build.sh
```

## Experiment
This compiles and runs (`mpiexec`) `root/test/orthotree/OrthoTreeTest.cpp`. Requires number of processors as args to run. There are also more optional args that can be passed, they can be seen with the command below.

**How to run:**
```bash
./experiment.sh <num_ranks> [optional args... (try -help)]
```

## Unit Tests
Compiles and runs our unit tests in `root/unit_tests/OrthoTree/*`. Will run all tests with 1 processor, except for the ones that require more, details below.

**How to run:**
```bash
./unit_tests.sh
```

**IMPORTNAT NOTE**

If you add a new unit test that requires a certain number of ranks to pass do the following two things:

1. Assert for number of procs in your testfile like this:
    ```cpp
    // sanity check, tests are designed to run (and pass) with {N} ranks
    TEST(MyTest, AssertWorldSize) {
        const size_t world_size = Comm->size();
        const size_t expected_world_size = N;
        ASSERT_EQ(world_size, expected_world_size) 
            << "Tests for MyTest algo can not pass with: " 
            << world_size << " ranks, needs: " << expected_world_size;
    }
    ```
2. Add your test name and required number of ranks to the top of `unit_tests.sh`


## Visualise Output
This passes on the args to `./experiment.sh`. The output generated by this will then be rendered by `visualise.py`

**How to run:**
```bash
./visualise.sh <num_ranks> [optional args... (try -help)]
```

The python script has two functions it can run. You have to toggle them manually in the file.

```python
data_folder = "output"

"""
This will generate one plot, where each processor will be colored differently. (not that usefull)
"""
# plot_combined_processors(data_folder)

"""
This generates one plot per processor. (default)
"""
plot_all_processors_in_subplots(data_folder)
```
